# Meru Number System Morphological Analyzer

This project implements a morphological analyzer for the Meru number system in the native Kenyan language, Meru. The analyzer takes a numerical input and generates the corresponding MeruNumber.

## Features

- Analyzes numbers from 1 to 999 and converts them to the MeruNumber representation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for the conversion is stored in a CSV file named `MeruNumbers.csv`. The file contains the following columns: NumberEquivalent, MeruNumber, and Grammar. The dataset covers numbers 1 to 100 and provides the corresponding MeruNumber and grammar for each number.

## Usage

To use the Meru Number System Morphological Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above).
